Your supporting document must provide a brief description of the steps taken during your data analysis process/data Viz tools, (if applicable, any statistical methods you have used along with model accuracy/model performance) and you must provide a brief interpretation/conclusions of your results/visualization. Do not exceed 2 pages (700 words). One page is preferred. Codes will be assessed during an initial Quality Assurance process to prevent any data misinterpretation.

If you upload your visual using either *Source* or *Embed url* in Step 3, upload the code and supporting files to a file storage platform such as Google Drive. Copy and paste the shareable link into the Description box below. Please make sure anyone with the link can view and download the files. But don't give access to edit.  
    
If you upload your visual using *Document* in Step 3, simply upload the files along with your visualization.
